          <h2>Why Lisbon?</h2>
          <h3>Lisbon, the city of seven hills</h3>
          <p>
            Lisbon is often referred to as the "City of Seven Hills" because it
            was traditionally said to be built on seven distinct hills, much
            like the ancient city of Rome. These hills give Lisbon its unique
            topography, with winding streets, steep inclines, and scenic
            viewpoints that offer panoramic vistas over the red-tiled rooftops
            and the Tagus River. The comparison to Rome also emphasizes Lisbon’s
            historical depth and cultural richness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seven hills: São Jorge, São Vicente, Sant’Ana, Santo André,
            Chagas, Santa Catarina, and São Roque—play a key role in shaping the
            city's layout and charm. Their presence has influenced everything
            from architecture to transportation, including the introduction of
            the famous yellow trams to help locals and visitors navigate the
            steep terrain. Today, the nickname remains a point of pride and
            identity for Lisbon, celebrating both its natural beauty and
            historical significance.

            <h4>Solar 31 Petisqueira & Italiano</h4>
            <p>
              A cozy hidden gem in Lisbon serving fresh seafood, tasty petiscos,
              and comforting Italian dishes with a warm, welcoming vibe.
            </p>
            <h5>Address</h5>
            <p>Alameda dos Oceanos 1, 1990-196 Lisboa</p>
            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
            <p>
              I love it because it’s the perfect mix of Portuguese tradition and
              Italian comfort food. The seafood is incredibly fresh, their
              octopus is especially tender and flavorful and I always feel like
              I’m being welcomed into someone’s home. The atmosphere is cozy,
              the staff are genuinely friendly, and the prices are fair for the
              quality you get. Whether I’m in the mood for a few petiscos or a
              hearty pasta dish, it never disappoints.

              I love how it combines the charm of a quiet garden with a modern,
              stylish atmosphere it’s like stepping into a little oasis right in
              the heart of Lisbon. Every time I go, I feel a sense of calm and
              comfort that’s hard to find in the middle of the city. The food is
              not only delicious but also thoughtfully prepared and beautifully
              presented, with a menu that’s full of creative options whether

            <h4>Sea Me Next Door</h4>
            <p>
              Sea Me Next Door offers a fresh, vibrant take on seafood, blending
              modern flair with traditional flavors in a relaxed, contemporary

            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
            <p>
              I love how it blends a casual vibe with incredible seafood, it
              feels relaxed and laid-back, but the quality of the food is always
              top-notch. It’s the kind of place where you can pop in for a quick
              bite or spend the evening sharing plates with friends, enjoying
              fresh flavors and creative twists on traditional Portuguese
              dishes. The atmosphere is lively but welcoming, and the service
              always makes me feel right at home. I especially enjoy how it
              brings a younger, more modern energy to Lisbon’s seafood scene
              without losing its authentic roots.
