          <h2>Why Lisbon?</h2>
          <h3>Lisbon, the city of seven hills</h3>
          <p>
            Lisbon is often referred to as the "City of Seven Hills" because it
            was traditionally said to be built on seven distinct hills, much
            like the ancient city of Rome. These hills give Lisbon its unique
            topography, with winding streets, steep inclines, and scenic
            viewpoints that offer panoramic vistas over the red-tiled rooftops
            and the Tagus River. The comparison to Rome also emphasizes Lisbon’s
            historical depth and cultural richness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seven hills: São Jorge, São Vicente, Sant’Ana, Santo André,
            Chagas, Santa Catarina, and São Roque—play a key role in shaping the
            city's layout and charm. Their presence has influenced everything
            from architecture to transportation, including the introduction of
            the famous yellow trams to help locals and visitors navigate the
            steep terrain. Today, the nickname remains a point of pride and
            identity for Lisbon, celebrating both its natural beauty and
            historical significance.
